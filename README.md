The app is based on an “Unbiased Translation” of the Holy Quraan. “Unbiased Translation” means keeping the following assumptions in mind while translating or comprehending the Quraan.

1. It is a book sent by God, directly for humans to read and “Understand”.
2. It was intended to be “A Message” from Allah, and the mesenger was The Holy Prophet.
3. Each verse is completely applicable even today, as it was the day it was revealed by The Prophet Muhammad 1400 years ago.
4. Each verse has been meticulously thought through as it is the “Word of God (Allah)” himself.
5. For those who truly believe that the entire universe and everything in it from stars, to the sun to the mood and the earth & the trees, to the birds, to the rivers, to the mountains & the clouds & all the animals & insects & us humans; All have been meticulously crafted & created by God (Allah); Then how can a book sent by him have even 1 verse which is not !?
6. Most or nearly all “Conventional Translations” are 
    1. Biased, based on the translators “View / Perception of reality” 
    2. What “They Think” Allah meant, not what his words actually say.
    3. Historical events & references, completely somtimes nullifying the fact that each verse is applicable even today.
7. Unfortunately over the centuries it has turned into something people, recite but do not understand; The example is like reading a car manual in Japanese and memorizing the manual but not understanding anything that’s written in it ! It servers no purpose !
8. While reading the Quraan, I have come to realize that over the years, humans have “Over complicated” everything related to religion, God only wanted to simplify things for us.
9. The 3 basic issues realized are 
    1. Too Much Context
    2. Too much Over Complication
    3. Personal Translator Ego
    
    These 3 things have continually been associated with Ayats (The Actual Messages), which have diluted the “True Meaning or Intent” and given too much importance to “The Context” instead of “The Ayat / Message” itself !
    
10. The purpose of this App is to educate people on what has really been said in The Quraan, and not what translators, historians or aalims “think” God meant.
